{"title":"Giants","content":"<p>These are not giants in the way that we might typically think of them. They are creatures that are larger than a human by some margin (the largest Giant stands at least a head taller than the tallest human). They are extremely muscular, with pale blue skin. They are heavily into body modification, particularly scarrification, and they have intricate designs of swirls across much of their bodies. They also have dermal peircings made of bone.<\/p>","drawer":"Creatures","id":"20210110131743"}
